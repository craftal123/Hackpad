Why i did it in the first place?:
I decided i wanted to make the hackpad because i always loved robotics and electronics, as i started making youtube and using my pc for editing i really wanted a streamer deck but it is too expensive for me, i saw about hackclub in a video but a few days ago i saw an instagram rell about the hackpad!
